# The COVID Prison Project

**Summary**

The UNC Health and Justice Research Lab developed the COVID Prison Project (CPP) in March of 2020 in response to a weak federal response to COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons, jails, and surrounding communities. The lab continues to aggregate nationwide COVID-19 testing data of incarcerated individuals and prison staff, as well as provide policy analysis. The team has automated much of the data collection using web scrapers which has reduced human error and opened up our time to plan for CPPâ€™s future. The team plans to broaden data collection to vaccine distribution, global testing, and general health data within the incarcerated population.
